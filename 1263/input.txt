Baptized with the perfect name
The dawning won by heart
Alone, without himself
War between him and the day
With someone to blame
In the end lil he can do alone
You believe on what you see
You receive on what you give
Caress the one
That never-fading rain
In your heart
To tears of snow-white sorrow
There is the one
That hiding Amaranth
In the land of the day-brave
Apart from the wandering path
In this brief flied up time
We reach for the ones who ever dare
You believe on what you see
You receive on what you give
Caress the one
That never-fading rain
In your heart
To tears of snow-white sorrow
There is the one
That hiding Amaranth
In the land of the day-brave
Reaching, searching
For something untouched
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling
There is the one
That never-fading rain
In your heart
To tears of snow-white sorrow
There is the one
That hiding Amaranth
In the land of the day-brave
